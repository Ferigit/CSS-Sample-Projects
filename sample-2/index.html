                        Professional photographers, for one. Please keep in mind that we're strictly amateur photographers. We submit these galleries
                        out of love and creative expression. We're not likely to remember the settings we took the picture
                        at, or even what lens we had. We're also not very exclusive. If you like what you see here, and want
                        to participate, we'd love to have you. All galleries, articles, and posts go through a submittal
                        and approval process, so if you're interested, drop us a line and tell us what you have in mind.

            Shea will discuss what your rights are when taking photos in a public space. Following her talk we'll have an open forum
            where you can ask questions, compare experiences, and become better informed as to what your responsibilities
            are as amateur photographers.
